# Milestone 1 - Dashboard proposal

## prework
- [ ] Each group member explores possible datasets
- [ ] meeting saturday to discuss and split off work, team work contract activity

## Overview

- [ ] Set up: GitHub issues, GitHub actions? 
- [ ] <1000 proposal words (motivation, audience)
- [ ] description of data (dataset and variables)
- [ ] research questions and usage (questions, persona, user story)
- [ ] app sketch (visual, 200-300 words)
- [ ] team work contract, code of conduct, contribution guidelines

## 1. Set up

- [ ] Name your repo something memorable.
- [x]  Pick a suitable licence. MIT and BSD-3 are common good options for open source projects. [The carpentries has a short primer on licenses](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/11-licensing/index.html) (optional read).
- [ ]  submit your repos on Gradescope, as usual.
- [ ]  Use GitHub issues to track features that you are planning to implement and bugs in the app.

## 2. Proposal (<1000 words proposal.md)


### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

- [ ]  provide motivation for why you are creating a dashboard.
- [ ]  Who is your target audience, and what role are you embodying?
- [ ] What problem could your dashboard solve for the intended user?

### Section 2: Description of the data

- [ ]  Expanded EDA: "cleaned up" and expanded EDA and description of the data
- [ ]  You must use one of the datasets that was previously approved in Data 550 for this project
- [ ]  briefly describe the dataset and the variables that you will visualize. (If you are planning to visualize a lot of columns, provide a high level descriptor of the variable types rather than listing every single column.)

### Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

- [ ]  Research question(s) you are exploring
- [ ]  [brief persona description](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/#personas) of a member in your intended target audience
- [ ]  write small user story for what they might do with your app.

## 3. Description of your app & sketch

- [ ] give a high-level description of the interface for the app you will build.
- [ ]  The app needs to have a few plot panels
- [ ]  You may choose to have two sketches, one for a realistic, achievable dashboard and another as a "stretch goal", something you can do if everything goes according to plan.
- [ ]  The description should be about 200-300 words and live in the `README.md` file of your GitHub.com repository.
- [ ] The sketch should be linked in the `README.md` file of your GitHub.com repository underneath the high level description so that the image shows up on GitHub.

## 4. Team work contract and collaborative documentation

### Team work contract

- [ ] How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?
- [ ] What are the expected work hours for the project? 
- [ ] How often will group meetings occur ([here is a nice article](http://third-bit.com/2018/05/11/meetings.html) on meetings)?
- [ ] Will you have meeting agendas and minutes? If so, what will be the system for rotating through these responsibilities?
- [ ] What will be the style of working?
    - [ ] Will you start each day with [stand-ups](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups), or submit a summary of your contributions 4 hours before each meeting? or something else?
- [ ] What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?
- [ ] When are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations).
- [ ] And any other similar things that govern your working relationships.


#### Activity for building a team work contract

- [ ] For 5 minutes, each team member will silently write out 4 different suggestions for the team work contract on their computer.
- [ ] Next, paste all suggestions into a common Google doc (or similar) and arrange them to put similar suggestions together.
- [ ] Spend 10 -15 minutes discussing the suggestions and decide which ones you will use for your team contract either by consensus or voting
- [ ] Add the final contract in a file called `team-contract.md` in the repo root

### Code of Conduct

- [ ] A statement on inclusivity and harassment free involvement in the project.
- [ ] Details on expected behaviour and unacceptable behaviour.
- [ ] A procedure for reporting unacceptable behaviour.


### Contribution guidelines
- [ ] add contribution guidelines

## 5. Start developing your app (Optional)
- [ ] foundations of the app layout with a few core dash components, maybe a plot even if they are not yet linked together.
