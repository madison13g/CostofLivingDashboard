# Reflection Milestone 2

Our dashboard allows a user to visualize information about the cost of living in different Canadian cities. A user can filter by province via checkboxes, as well as filter population with a slider. A feature we would like to add is a text box with the information of what population range was selected. We'd also like to implement that when the 'select all' checkbox is unselected, all the options get unselected.


In the first plot, users can select a variable through a drop down and see all cities ranked according to its cost, in ascending order. A tooltip is implemented so users can see exact values. In the second plot, users can select two variables to compare the cost of, with a tooltip enabled so they can see which point belongs to which city, and the exact values. We'd like to make the aesthetics better, for example by making the points bigger. In the third plot, users can select  a variable and specific cities and compare the cost across them. The plot is sorted in ascending order as well.


Overall, we would like to add colour coding to the visualization according to provinces, with Maritimes and Territories grouped, in which case we'd end up with 8 different colours so as not to visually overload. We'd also like to implement a second tab with description of variables, and add a filtering option by variable group (food, housing, transportation, etc). We'd also like to design the overall dashboard better so it is more appealing to look at.


All in all our dashboard as is is effectively as described in our proposal sketch. The plots and filters have been implemented well, as well as the layout. Limitations are the aesthetics, and that the dashboard could be improved to serve a user even better. In addition to the possible improvements outlined above, we'd like to add an interactive map of the country that outlines the provinces chosen and pinpoints the cities included.
